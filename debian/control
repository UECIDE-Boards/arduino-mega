Description: Arduino Mega (ATmega1280)
 The Arduino Mega is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega1280. It has
 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16
 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator,
 a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It
 contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect
 it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or
 battery to get started. The Mega is compatible with most shields designed
 for the Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila.
